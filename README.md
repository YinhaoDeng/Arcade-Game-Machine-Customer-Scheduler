## Game Setup
Consider a single person arcade game machine located in a shopping centre. While many customers wish to play, there is only one machine, so it is a shared resource. Customers willing to play arrive at random times and if the machine is occupied, they need to wait. This is a very advanced shopping centre and the use of the machine is facilitated by a robot manager(programmed by you!). In particular, the robot may decide that a customer is playing for too long and ask the customer to release the machine and move back to the waiting queue.

Based on the membership with the gaming company, there are two customer priorities: high for members and regular for non-members. Also, to facilitate scheduling, each customer must declare how many time units they will be playing for in total. Once a customer spends this amount of time at the machine (in one or multiple sessions), they leave.

You need to write a program that decides which customer should be playing when.

## Marking
We will test your submission on 5 randomly generated test data files. These test data files will not be released, but they are generated by the same stochastic (random) process used to generate the provided data files. For each test file, we will compare your scheduling with the scheduling produced by "baseline.cpp" for the same input.

For each of the 5 test input files:
- Your program produces a valid output scheduling: **+0.3 marks**
- Only if your scheduling is valid, we will proceed as follows:
  - Your scheduling is different from baseline: **+0.3 marks**
  - Your scheduling has a smaller total wait time as compared to the baseline: **+0.6 mark**
  - Your scheduling has a smaller longest response time as compared to the baseline: **+0.6 marks**
  - Your scheduling contains fewer switches between customers as compared to the baseline: **+0.6 marks**
  - Your scheduling has a smaller total wait time for high priority customers as compared to the total wait time for regular customers: **+0.6 marks** (this one is not compared against baseline)
 
**Maximum total mark**: 15 = 5 x (0.3 + 0.3 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.6) 

### :sunglasses: My strategy receives full marks based on marking criteria mentioned above. :fist_right:The baseline is flattened.

Happy learning! Please use this repo as guide, copying and pasting is not helpful for you.
